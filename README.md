# Tic-Tac-Toe
This repository is my solution to [Tic-Tac-Toe project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/0/tictactoe/) of [Introduction to Articial Intelligence with Python](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home) course by Harvard.

## ðŸš€ How to execute:
- Clone the repository using git clone 
- Install the dependencies listed on requirements.txt
- Run "python runner.py" on your terminal to play against my AI!

Observation: Let me know if you beat my AI!

## ðŸ”Ž Understanding:
There are two main files in this project: runner.py and tictactoe.py.
- [tictactoe.py](/tictactoe.py) contains all of the logic for playing the game, and for making optimal moves. 
- [runner.py](/runner.py) contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game.
The functions are very well explained in the code.
